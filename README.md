# 2021 VRDL HW1: Bird Images Classification

This repository is the HW1 of 2021 Selected Topics in Visual Recognition using Deep Learning in NYCU.

## Environment

Framework: [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)  

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To `train.py` and `eval.py` directory:

```src
cd src
```

## Training

To train the model(s) in the project, run this command:

```train
python train.py
```

> ðŸ“‹  Please modify `model_name` in `train.py` to the model you wanted.  
> ðŸ“‹  Model name can be select in `['resnet', 'inception', 'swin_transformer_base_224', 'swin_transformer_large_384']`.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py
```

>ðŸ“‹  Please modify `model_name` in `eval.py` to the model you wanted,  
>ðŸ“‹  and `timestamp` in `eval.py` to the training weights that you want to load.
